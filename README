utxx - an open-source collection of C++ miscelaneous components
===============================================================

    This dual-licenced library provides a set of classes that
    complement C++ and boost with functionality needed by many
    applications.

    The library is free to use under LGPLv2 license for
    non-commercial projects, and has a commercial open source licence
    for commercial use (contact the author for commercial
    licensing details).
    
    The components include:

    - Custom allocators
    - Atomic functions
    - Bitmap mask with fast iteration
    - BOOST wait_timeout, repeating timer
    - Buffer for I/O handling
    - Concurrent array/fifo/priority_queue/stack/hashmap
    - Fast delegates
    - Type conversion routines
    - Endian-handling
    - Exception error classes with dynamic number of arguments
    - Hashmap abstraction
    - UDP receiver
    - Logging framework
    - Math functions
    - Metaprogramming functions
    - Persistent blob and array
    - Futex signaling
    - PCAP format reader
    - Throttling components
    - PID file manager
    - Variant / variant tree components
    - Exceptions with error source location
    - Reflectable enums
    - Configuration framework with option validation (SCON configuration format support)
